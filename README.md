# odin-recipes
This is a simple project: I'm studying html and css through TheOdinProject and this lesson is about to manage to create a recipe website on my own (sort of).
Although TheOdinProject take you by the hand to accomplish that, I'm a bit familiar to html, css and javascript already, even though it's been a while since I last study it.
So, in this project I'll try out html, css and javascript basicly. I'm not sure if I'm goingo through react and node right now. I'll probably find our later on.
